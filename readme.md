# Daily Planner

The Daily Planner will help you schedule your work day. It is always current with today's date. The time is also current, and upon refreshing the page, the time blocks will be color-coded according to a state in the past, present, or  future. You can enter your "To Do" items in each hourly time block and save them by clicking the "save" button. The Daily Planner runs in the browser, but don't worry, even if you refresh the page, the saved entries will remain.
